# Naming Convention Exercise - 1

# Meaningful variables tell you what the variable representsâ€‹

a = "Amrita "
b = " Vishwa "
c = "Vidyapeetham"
name1, name2, name3 = a, b, c       #Sorry if the variable names still dont make sense. Couldnt think of anything else.

# rename the above variables
# Choose appropriate names for variable and print the concatenated result
print(name1, name2, name3,end="")       #since you have already added space to the variable value, i removed the space over here.
